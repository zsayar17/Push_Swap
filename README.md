# Push_Swap
This project provides a comprehensive solution for sorting numbers based on specific rules which are implemented at below. It employs two distinct stacks and utilizes both the Wheels and radix sort algorithms. These sorting techniques are applied in conjunction with the linked list data structure to efficiently organize and manage the numeric data. By combining these elements, the project offers a robust approach to sorting numbers while adhering to the prescribed rules.
 
"rotate a" (Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one), 

"rotate b" ( Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one), 

"reverse rotate a" (Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.), 

"reverse rotate b" (Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.), 

"swap a" (Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements), 

"swap b" (Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements), 

"push a" (Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty), 

"push b" (Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty)
